# 📺 Hotstar Clone – OTT Platform UI

A front-end clone of Hotstar built using **React.js**, designed to replicate the look and feel of a modern OTT streaming platform. This project focuses on responsive design, reusable components, and a clean, modular codebase.

---

## 🔄 Project Background

An earlier version of this project was initially prototyped using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** to explore layout ideas and core UI structure. Due to time constraints and the need for better scalability and component reusability, the project was **rebuilt directly using React.js**. 

> ⚠️ *Note: The initial prototype is not included in this repository. The current version is a fresh implementation using React.*
